  \ where he established an unparalleled record of achievement, improving public safety,\
  \ enhancing legal services to protect vulnerable citizens, promoting education,\

  \ strengthening community health and environmental quality.\r \r That level of service\
  \ to his community continues today as a member of the Texas State Senate. Sen. Rodr\xED\
  guez is a staunch advocate for those in need. He has proven himself an effective\
  \ voice for SD 29, passing more than 240 bills during his five sessions in the Texas\

  \ standalone university component of the Texas Tech University System as well as\
  \ a series of bills to address cheating and accountability in standardized testing\
  \ in our schools. \r \r His hard work and tenacity on the Senate floor have gained\
  \ him numerous accolades, including being named \"Freshman MVP\" by  , \"Legislative\
  \ Hero\" by Texas Access to Justice Foundation, \"Best of Senate\" by the Combined\
  \ Law Enforcement Association of Texas, \"Advocate of the Year, Elected Official\"\

  \ of the Texas Senate Democratic Caucus (SDC), and as a member of the Senate Committees\
  \ on Agriculture (Vice Chair), Natural Resources & Economic Development, Transportation,\

  \ of the Texas Senate Hispanic Caucus for nearly two years. \r \r In addition, Sen.\
  \ Rodr\xEDguez serves as one of only five U.S. Presidential appointees on the 10-member\
  \ Board of Directors of the Border Environment Cooperation Commission-North American\
  \ Development Bank (BECC-NADB), which has distributed $2.6 billion in loans and\
  \ grants for over 200 BECC-certified infrastructure projects on both sides of the\
  \ border.\r \r The son of migrant farm workers, Sen. Rodr\xEDguez was born in Alice,\
  \ Texas. From an early age, he worked in fields throughout the country to help support\
  \ a family of nine. The first in his family to attend college, he received his undergraduate\

  \ Law Center at George Washington University in 1974. Since 1983, Sen. Rodr\xED\
  guez and his family have made their home in El Paso, where they have been deeply\
  \ involved in civic, economic development, and human rights activities."
