Page processsing:
  * Constructor is invoked, sets input and source
  * any dependencies are then invoked
      (describe this a bit more, each dependency sets a self.__ variable based on page output)
  * if there isn't a source set, get_source_from_input will be called
  * sources that are strings are converted to URLs 
  * self.response is populated from source.get_response
  * self.postprocess_response()
  * self.process_page()
